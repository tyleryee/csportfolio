    <h2 id="howtoheader">How To</h2>
    <p class="howto">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) was used to create the whole About Me page ifrom specific color to text in a paragraph. I created a page that was informational and simple. The page created was information all about me and all of the things I like to do on my free
        time. I created the page this way because I like the layout and how simplistic it looks. The project work is great and easy to learn. Since the project work is mainly HTML and CSS it is very straight forward and easy for me. CSS gave the webpage
        color since it will be pretty boring without any color to make the webpage pop. HTML made the structure of the webpage which gives it text.<br><strong>And this is how I created it.</strong></p>

    <h3>HTML Set Up</h3>
    <p class="howto">In Cloud 9, to have the basic sturcture of HTML you have to press !tab. This will give basics tags like head, body, title. With all of these tags and elements that you typed in to HTML you have to use nesting. Nesting is a way of organizing the HTML
        to where you can clearly keep track of all of the tags and elements.<br> <strong>This is what nesting looks like.</strong></p>

    <h3>Specific Tags and Functions</h3>

            <div class="sameline">
                <p class="howto">In order to write a paragraph, you have tags which allows you to write and appear on the page. The paragraph tags allows you to type a paragraph or text into your webpage. In order to have text on your webpage you need to type in-between
                    the tags to create an element which will display on the webpage.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="sameline">
                <p class="howto">To have headers on your page, you need to know that their are six sizes (h1-h6). H1 should be the main header since it is the biggest out of all of the headers while h6 is the smallest header. To create a header you need to type in-between
                    the tags to make an element.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <h3>Choices</h3>
    <p class="howto">The choices that I had to make was having the list of hobbies and the list of achievements on the same line. I made this choice because I though that the webpage would look neater than having the list on top of each other. I made this change by adding
        a code listed as #LOA and #LOH to the CSS and making the list to half of the page. The # is an id that is use to place certian CSS functions that one element. Classes start with a . in CSS which you can put in muliple elements to to have certain functions in
        CSS. Classes and ids are the same but should be kept seperate due to different CSS funtions that you want to place.</p>

    <p class="howto">Also I made the choice of having a navigation bar in my webpage for easy access to all of my webpages. This choice was also for the looks of my page. The navigation bar adds nice proportions and access to many more webpages that I will create in the
        future. I created the navigation bar by linking a separate CSS page to my webpages and the adjusting it to how I like it to be on the page.</p>

    <h3>One Thing Learned</h3>
    <p class="howto">One thing that I learned throughout this project was the basics of HTML. I learned the code which are tags and elements. I learned this because this is the base of programing for all other programing. I will remember certian tags that are very common
        and will be very helpful for future projects. Also I will remember how to put images into HTML. Images will be helpful for the future as it will help discribe what is happening with the writing more. Images have a easy tag to remember since their
        is no closing tag. The tag is <strong>img src="link to image"</strong>.<br><strong>Bellow is an example of what the tag will look like in HTML.</strong></p>
